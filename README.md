### Welcome to my corner!

Thank you for stopping by!
I'm Evelyn (or 'Jaxydog' online)
and I go by [she / her](https://en.pronouns.page/@Jaxydog).

Most of my projects are CLI tools, Discord bots, and Minecraft mods.
<br/>
If you're interested in my work
(even if it *is* sometimes very silly and/or unprofessional),
feel free to look through my repositories.

Outside of programming,
I also occasionally draw mediocre artwork,
and very rarely make terrible instrumental music.
