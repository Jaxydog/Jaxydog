## Welcome to my corner!

I'm Jaxydog, or just Jaxy for short.<br/>
I go by [any pronouns](https://en.pronouns.page/@Jaxydog), so just use what feels right to you.

## What do I do?

I usually work on mods for Minecraft, Discord bots, and random CLI tools, among other various things.<br/>
After meandering through various fields, I've found that I tend to most enjoy both game programming *and* systems programming.<br/>
If you're interested in what I'm working on, feel free to look through my repositories.

Outside computer science, I also occasionally ~~fail to~~ make art and music.
